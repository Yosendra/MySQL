Database is a collection of data, stored in a format that can easily be accessed.
In order to manage our database, we use a software application called Database Management System (DBMS).
We connect to a DBMS and give it instruction for querying or modifying data.
The DBMS will execute our instruction and send results back.
DBMS can be classified into two categories, relational and non relational (also called NoSQL).
